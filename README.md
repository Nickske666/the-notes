# The Notes

Compiling the notes generator is as easy as running `make`.
Generating the notes is done with `./the-notes`.

You can also generate subsets of the notes by adding selectors to the command.

- `./the-notes sets` will only generate the chapter on sets.
- `./the-notes sets.basics` will only generate the 'basics' section of the sets chapter
- `./the-notes sets probability` will only generate the chapters on sets and probability.
